# Interactive Rebase Challenge

This is a basic challenge to help practice the interactive rebase command


## Instructions 

1. Squash the pair of superhero and secret identity commits into one commit.
2. Squash all the dc-based superhero commits into one commit.
3. Squash all the marvel-based superhero commits into one commit.
4. Create aliases/diana_prince.txt file and append Wonder Woman to superhero_list.txt file
5. Squash above wonder woman commit into dc-bashed superhero commit

## Hint

All the commit messages with a superhero name are changes to superhero_list.txt.   
All the commit messages with a superhero's secret identity are add files.   

## Solution

A correct solution should have only 2 commits for all the superhero madness.   
Silverback shouldn't be in the superhero_list.txt
Wonder Woman should appear in superhero_list.txt
Should have diana_prince.txt file in aliases directory
If done correctly rebase should not cause any conflicts.   

The solution is available on the solution branch.

```
git checkout solution
```
